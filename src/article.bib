@article{gordon2001,
    abstract = {{Currently, the genome sequencing community is producing shotgun sequence data at a very high rate, but finishing (collecting additional directed sequence data to close gaps and improve the quality of the data) is not matching that rate. One reason for the difference is that shotgun sequencing is highly automated but finishing is not: Most finishing decisions, such as which directed reads to obtain and which specialized sequencing techniques to use, are made by people. If finishing rates are to increase to match shotgun sequencing rates, most finishing decisions also must be automated. The Autofinish computer program (which is part of the computer software package) does this by automatically choosing finishing reads. Autofinish is able to suggest most finishing reads required for completion of each sequencing project, greatly reducing the amount of human attention needed. sometimes completely finishes the project, with no human decisions required. It cannot solve the most complex problems, so we recommend that Autofinish be allowed to suggest reads for the first three rounds of finishing, and if the project still is not finished completely, a human finisher complete the work. We compared this Autofinish-Hybrid method of finishing against a human finisher in five different projects with a variety of shotgun depths by finishing each project twice--once with each method. This comparison shows that the Autofinish-Hybrid method saves many hours over a human finisher alone, while using roughly the same number and type of reads and closing gaps at roughly the same rate. Autofinish currently is in production use at several large sequencing centers. It is designed to be adaptable to the finishing strategy of the lab--it can finish using some or all of the following: resequencing reads, reverses, custom primer walks on either subclone templates or whole clone templates, PCR, or minilibraries. Autofinish has been used for finishing cDNA, genomic clones, and whole bacterial genomes (see http://www.phrap.org).}},

@article{pop2004,
    abstract = {{The output of a genome assembler generally comprises a collection of contiguous DNA sequences (contigs) whose relative placement along the genome is not defined. A procedure called scaffolding is commonly used to order and orient these contigs using paired read information. This ordering of contigs is an essential step when finishing and analyzing the data from a whole-genome shotgun project. Most recent assemblers include a scaffolding module; however, users have little control over the scaffolding algorithm or the information produced. We thus developed a general-purpose scaffolder, called Bambus, which affords users significant flexibility in controlling the scaffolding parameters. Bambus was used recently to scaffold the low-coverage draft dog genome data. Most significantly, Bambus enables the use of linking data other than that inferred from mate-pair information. For example, the sequence of a completed genome can be used to guide the scaffolding of a related organism. We present several applications of Bambus: support for finishing, comparative genomics, analysis of the haplotype structure of genomes, and scaffolding of a mammalian genome at low coverage. Bambus is available as an open-source package from our Web site.}},

@article{nagarajan2010,
    abstract = {{While new sequencing technologies have ushered in an era where microbial genomes can be easily sequenced, the goal of routinely producing high-quality draft and finished genomes in a cost-effective fashion has still remained elusive. Due to shorter read lengths and limitations in library construction protocols, shotgun sequencing and assembly based on these technologies often results in fragmented assemblies. Correspondingly, while draft assemblies can be obtained in days, finishing can take many months and hence the time and effort can only be justified for high-priority genomes and in large sequencing centers. In this work, we revisit this issue in light of our own experience in producing finished and nearly-finished genomes for a range of microbial species in a small-lab setting. These genomes were finished with surprisingly little investments in terms of time, computational effort and lab work, suggesting that the increased access to sequencing might also eventually lead to a greater proportion of finished genomes from small labs and genomics cores.}},

Contig ordering (also known as gap closure) is a non-trivial algorithmic and experimental problem since even relatively simple-to-assemble bacterial genomes typically result in large set of contigs. Neighboring contigs maybe separated either by gaps in read coverage or by repeats. In the later case we say that the contigs are separated by pseudogaps, and we emphasize the important difference between gap closure and pseudogap closure. The existing gap closure approaches do not distinguish between gaps and pseudogaps and treat them in the same way. We describe a new fast strategy for closing pseudogaps (repeat resolution). Since in highly repetitive genomes, the number of pseudogaps may exceed the number of gaps by an order of magnitude, this approach provides a significant advantage over the existing gap closure methods.}},

We present a new tool OSLay that uses synteny between matching sequences in a target assembly and a reference assembly to layout the contigs (or scaffolds) in the target assembly. The underlying algorithm is based on maximum weight matching. The tool provides an interactive visualization of the computed layout and the result can be imported into the assembly editing tool Consed to support the design of primer pairs for gap closure.Motivation: To enhance efficiency in the gap closure phase of a genome project it is crucial to know which contigs are adjacent in the target genome.

We propose a novel algorithm to align contigs with more than one reference genome at a time. This approach can successfully overcome the limitations of low degrees of conserved gene order for the reference and target genomes. A pheromone trail-based genetic algorithm (PGA) was used to search globally for the optimal placement for each contig. Extensive testing on simulated and real data sets shows that PGA significantly outperforms previous methods, especially when assembling genomes that are only moderately related. An extended version of PGA can predict additional candidate connections for each contig and can thus increase the likelihood of identifying the correct arrangement of each contig. The software and test data sets can be accessed at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pga4genomics/.}},

To address this limitation, we developed ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs ≥100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68\% of the reference human genome.

    abstract = {{The emergence of next-generation sequencing platforms led to resurgence of research in whole-genome shotgun assembly algorithms and software. DNA sequencing data from the Roche 454, Illumina/Solexa, and ABI SOLiD platforms typically present shorter read lengths, higher coverage, and different error profiles compared with Sanger sequencing data. Since 2005, several assembly software packages have been created or revised specifically for de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing data. This review summarizes and compares the published descriptions of packages named SSAKE, SHARCGS, VCAKE, Newbler, Celera Assembler, Euler, Velvet, ABySS, AllPaths, and SOAPdenovo. More generally, it compares the two standard methods known as the de Bruijn graph approach and the overlap/layout/consensus approach to assembly.}},

Several genome assemblers have been published in recent years specifically targeted at the new sequence data; however, the ever-changing technological landscape leads to the need for continued research. In addition, the low cost of next generation sequencing data has led to an increased use of sequencing in new settings. For example, the new field of metagenomics relies on large-scale sequencing of entire microbial communities instead of isolate genomes, leading to new computational challenges. In this article, we outline the major algorithmic approaches for genome assembly and describe recent developments in this domain.}},

    abstract = {{New DNA sequencing technologies can sequence up to one billion bases in a single day at low cost, putting large-scale sequencing within the reach of many scientists. Many researchers are forging ahead with projects to sequence a range of species using the new technologies. However, these new technologies produce read lengths as short as 35-40 nucleotides, posing challenges for genome assembly and annotation. Here we review the challenges and describe some of the bioinformatics systems that are being proposed to solve them. We specifically address issues arising from using these technologies in assembly projects, both de novo and for resequencing purposes, as well as efforts to improve genome annotation in the fragmented assemblies produced by short read lengths.}},
